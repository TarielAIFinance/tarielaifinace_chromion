JSON-RPC
JSON-RPC endpoints refers to the network location where a program could transfer its RPC requests to access server data. Once you connect a decentralized application to an RPC endpoint, you can access the functionalities of different operations, which could enable real-time usage of blockchain data. EXPchain provides several RPC endpoints for connecting into both its Mainnet and Testnet. In this section, we list the JSON-RPC endpoints that can be used for connecting to EXPchain.
